# React Advanced Concepts and Custom Hooks

## 1. Custom Hooks and Single Responsibility Principle
- **Key Concept**: Custom hooks in React are functions that allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each custom hook should do one thing well to ensure maintainability and modularity in your code.

## 2. Modularity
- Writing modular code ensures that each component or function handles a specific part of the logic, which improves code reusability and maintainability.

## 3. Creating Custom Hooks
- **useRestaurantMenu**: An example custom hook for fetching restaurant menu data.
- **useEffect and fetch**: Used inside custom hooks to perform side effects like data fetching.
- **Optimizing Code**: Custom hooks help reduce repetitive code and centralize logic for better performance and code clarity.

## 4. Creating a Custom Hook Package
- Custom hooks can be packaged and reused across projects. Examples include hooks for online/offline status detection.

## 5. Online/Offline Status Hook
- **Hook for Network Status**: Create a custom hook (`useOnlineStatus.js`) under the `utils` folder to determine if the user is online or offline.
- **Coding the Hook**: Implementing the logic in the custom hook and testing it by toggling the network status in the browser’s dev console.

## 6. Visual Indicators for Network Status
- Build reusable React components to display a green or red dot indicating online or offline status.

## 7. Naming Custom Hooks
- **"use" Prefix**: It’s not mandatory, but it's a best practice to start hook names with “use” to follow conventions and make them identifiable as hooks.

## 8. Code Optimization Techniques
- **Refactoring**: Continuously improve custom hooks and components for better performance and maintainability.
- **Examples**: Optimize the code structure for readability and efficiency.

## 9. Advanced React Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Break components into smaller chunks that load only when needed to improve application performance.
- **Code-Splitting and Chunking**: Use techniques like `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for loading components dynamically.
- **Dynamic Bundling**: Load only the required modules for faster load times.

## 10. Suspense in React
- The `Suspense` component is used to wrap lazy-loaded components, providing a fallback UI while the component is being loaded.

## 11. Applying Lazy Loading to Multiple Pages
- Extend lazy loading and code-splitting to other pages to further enhance performance.

## 12. Interview Tips
- Stay updated with React best practices, code optimization techniques, and advanced features like custom hooks and lazy loading for better interview readiness.

### Conclusion
These advanced React concepts, including creating custom hooks, optimizing code, lazy loading, and code-splitting, are essential for building efficient and maintainable React applications. Implementing these techniques ensures better performance and a smoother user experience.
