# Namaste React - Testing Setup

## Topics Covered

This section covers various types of testing from a developer's perspective:

- **Manual Testing**: Testing features manually by interacting with the application.
- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual units/components in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Testing multiple units/components together to ensure they work as a group.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulating real user scenarios to test the complete flow of the application.

## Setting Up Testing in a React App

To enable testing in a React application, the following steps are involved:

- **React Testing Library** is used to test components in a way that mimics user behavior.
- **Jest** is the test runner and assertion library used to run and manage tests.
- **Babel** is configured to transpile modern JavaScript and JSX code so that Jest can understand it.
- **Parcel Configuration** (if using Parcel as the bundler) needs adjustment to disable its default Babel transpilation so custom Babel settings can take effect.
- **Jest Initialization** involves setting up configuration options to suit the projectâ€™s needs.
- **JSDOM** is used to simulate a browser-like environment for testing React components.
- **Testing the Setup** ensures that Jest and the testing libraries are correctly integrated and functioning as expected.

This setup allows writing and running meaningful tests for a robust React application.
