## Q: What is `Microservice`?
A: `Microservice` - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services like database, server or a UI of the application, that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
means we are dividing software into small, well-defined modules enables teams to use functions for multiple purposes.

- Benefits of Microservices:
  - Flexible Scaling
  - Easy Deployment
  - Technological Freedom
  - Reusable Code
  - Resilience

## Q: What is `Monolith architecture`?
A: A `Monolith architecture` is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.
means we are not dividing software into small, well-defined modules, we use every services like, database, server or a UI of the application, in one Application file.

## Q: What is the difference between `Monolith and Microservice`?
A: With `monolithic architectures`, all processes are tightly coupled and run as a single service. This means that if one process of the application experiences a spike in demand, the entire architecture must be scaled. Adding or improving a monolithic applicationâ€™s features becomes more complex as the code base grows. This complexity limits experimentation and makes it difficult to implement new ideas. Monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled processes increase the impact of a single process failure.

With a `microservices architecture`, an application is built as independent components that run each application process as a service. These services communicate via a well-defined interface using lightweight APIs. Services are built for business capabilities and each service performs a single function. Because they are independently run, each service can be updated, deployed, and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application.

## Q: Why do we need a `useEffect Hook`?
A: `useEffect Hook` is javascript function provided by `react`. The useEffect Hook allows you to  `eliminate side effects` in your components. Some examples of side effects are: `fetching API data`, `directly updating the DOM`, and `setting up subscriptions or timers`, etc can be lead to unwarranted side-effects.
useEffect accepts `two arguments`, a `callback function` and a `dependency array`. The second argument is optional.

```
useEffect(() => {}, [])
```
The `() => {}` is callback function and `[]` is called a empty dependency array. 
If anything that we pass (suppose currentState) inside the `[]` it trigger the callback function and changes the state of the application.
```
useEffect(() => {
    setCurrentState("true");
}, [currentState])
```
If we do not pass empty dependency array then the useEffect runs everytime when the UI is rendered.

```
useEffect(() => {})
```
