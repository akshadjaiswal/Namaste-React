# React Redux and Redux Toolkit Learning Notes

## 1. Redux is not a mandatory thing
Redux is a state management library that helps manage and centralize application state. However, it is not mandatory to use Redux in React applications. If your app’s state management needs are simple, you can rely on React’s built-in `useState` or `useReducer` hooks. Redux is typically used when an application has:
- Complex state management needs.
- A requirement to share state across multiple components.
- Predictable state update requirements.

In smaller applications, Redux may add unnecessary complexity, and simpler solutions are often preferred.

## 2. Exploring Redux
Redux operates on three core principles:
1. **Single Source of Truth**: The state of the application is stored in a single object called the "store."
2. **State is Read-Only**: The state can only be modified by dispatching actions.
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers, which are pure functions, specify how the state changes in response to actions.

The primary components of Redux include:
- **Store**: Holds the state.
- **Actions**: Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened.
- **Reducers**: Functions that determine how the state changes based on actions.

## 3. Redux and React are Separate Libraries
Redux and React are independent libraries. Redux is a JavaScript library for managing state, and React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 

To use Redux with React, you typically use the `react-redux` library. This library provides tools like `Provider`, `useDispatch`, and `useSelector` to connect Redux’s state management to React components. The separation of concerns allows Redux to be used with other frameworks or vanilla JavaScript as well.

## 4. Exploring Redux Toolkit (RTK)
Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended approach to writing Redux logic. It simplifies the setup and development process while avoiding common pitfalls of Redux. RTK provides:
- **`configureStore`**: Simplifies store setup.
- **`createSlice`**: Combines action creators and reducers into a single slice.
- **`createAsyncThunk`**: Handles asynchronous logic like API calls.
- Built-in support for immutability and debugging with Redux DevTools.

RTK reduces boilerplate code and makes Redux more approachable.

## 5. RTK Architecture
The architecture of RTK is designed to streamline the development process:
1. **Store**: Created using `configureStore`, which automatically sets up middleware and DevTools.
2. **Slices**: Encapsulate reducers and actions for specific pieces of state.
3. **Async Thunks**: Handle asynchronous logic in a structured way.
4. **Selectors**: Functions to retrieve and compute derived state.
5. **Middleware**: Extends Redux functionality, often for handling side effects.

This architecture encourages modularity and maintainability.

## 6. Slices
A "slice" in Redux Toolkit represents a piece of the Redux state and contains:
- **Initial State**: The default state for the slice.
- **Reducers**: Define how the state changes in response to actions.
- **Actions**: Automatically generated for each reducer.

The `createSlice` function simplifies the process by combining actions and reducers into a single unit. Each slice manages its own logic, promoting a modular structure.

## 7. Selector
Selectors are functions used to extract or derive specific parts of the state from the Redux store. They:
- Help keep components clean by abstracting state access logic.
- Can compute derived data efficiently using libraries like Reselect.

Selectors are typically defined alongside the slices they relate to and accessed using the `useSelector` hook in React components.

## 8. Provider and Reducers
### Provider:
The `Provider` component from `react-redux` is used to make the Redux store available to the entire application. It wraps the root component and passes the store as a prop.

### Reducers:
Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state changes based on dispatched actions. In RTK, reducers are often defined within slices, making them easier to manage.

## 9. useDispatch() and dispatch()
### `useDispatch()`:
This hook, provided by `react-redux`, gives access to the `dispatch` function. It is used to send actions to the Redux store.

### `dispatch()`:
The `dispatch` function is used to trigger actions, which then flow through the reducers to update the state. When using RTK, actions are automatically generated by slices and dispatched using this method.

By combining `useDispatch` and `dispatch`, you can easily integrate Redux actions into React components.
